A way to completely customize each Post/Page by assigning almost any part of it to Widgets. 

== Description ==

This plugin is a collection of Widgets that will help you display different parts of your Posts & Pages wherever you want (as long as you can put a Widget there) and not be limited to the boxy article section.

Its highly flexible class structure lets you group style the results or individually design each element. 

All the Widget Content is saved and can be controlled from within the relevant Post/Page.  

**On the current version, you can show :**
 
* Deploy Image Attachment to any Sidebar. 
* Add any Custom Fields content (which basically means anything) to any Sidebar.
* Using simple shortcode, create a page/post specific navigations.
* Using simple shortcode, assign different sections of the post/page content to Widgets.

**Example Uses :**

* Adding Screenshots to the sidebar of the page of your latest app/plugin.
* On a post about a great hike you took, Add your favourite Photos to the sidebar without breaking the flow of the content.
* Add a custom background, border, frame for each Post or Page.
* If writing a long Article, add a Wikipedia-like Article Navigation Menus at the sidebar.
* Add relevant article content in a slick way to the sidebars.
* Creating galleries within single posts, or to each post in a loop.
* And many more ...

In order to maximize your ability to design the content, you can also assign specific classes to each attachment and contain them in a container div.
